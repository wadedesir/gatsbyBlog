### Gatsby CLI

The Gatsby command line interface (CLI) is a tool that lets you quickly create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites.

The CLI is a published npm package, which means you can install it using npm.

Install the Gatsby CLI globally by running the command below. (Have an older version of the Gatsby CLI installed? This command will also update you to the latest version.)

```shell

```

**Note:** When you install Gatsby and run it for the first time, you’ll see a short message notifying you about anonymous usage data that is being collected for Gatsby commands. You can read more about how that data is pulled out and used in the [telemetry doc](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/telemetry).

Check that you have the correct version installed by running the command below. You should be on v3 or newer.

```shell

```

See the available commands:

```shell

```
